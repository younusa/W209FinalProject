<t> <h4><b> About the Project:</b></h4>   <p class = 'projecttext'>Welcome to our personal care product insight website! 
 We are here to guide you in finding products based upon ingredients, common allergens, and socially conscious brands.
 If you have always wanted to find an allergen free brand, this site is for you. 
 To get an overview of data, please visit our <a href="homepage.html" style="text-decoration: underline;" ><b>Tableau</b></a> page.  
 To learn more about a product, you can click on its entry and a hyperlink will become available for you to click.  
 On the Tableau page, you can find out of your product contains an allergen, is cruelty-free, and which retailers offer the product.
If you want to find a product similar to your chosen product, head over to the 
<a href="Similar_Products.html" style="text-decoration: underline;" ><b>Similar Products</b></a>  page and use our JavaScript/D3 tool to find other similar products.  
This is helpful if you are interested in price comparison, and you want to find the most similar brands to your chosen products for you next stop to the stores.
Our data was provided by the open source project Open Beauty Facts,
 a user-contributed database whose goals include helping consumers get as much information about cosmetic and personal care products as possible.  
 We augmented this data with PETA’s cruelty-free cosmetic list to determine brands with social consciousness.  
 While the OBF website has allergen information on their website, the database download does not, 
 so we used WebMD’s list of common skin allergen for our allergen analysis.  For more information, please visit our
 <a href="Data_Sources.html" style="text-decoration: underline;" ><b>Data Sources</b></a> page.</p>
